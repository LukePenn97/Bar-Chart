<h2 class="about">About This Project</h2>
<p id="aboutproject">
This is a project for the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp, starting on March 29 2021. <br>
I started working on this prep project on March 20th, and it is now March 27th at the time of writing.<br>
I am happy with my work, and I am looking forward to the main course. I am most proud of the build a chart page,<br>
as it was not required for the project, and I think it turned out well. <br>

<h3 class="about">About Me</h3>
<p id="aboutme">
My name is Luke Penner, I am 24 years old and living in an apartment in downtown Victoria. Before this bootccamp, <br>
I was working as a mental health worker at a homeless shelter. I helped people who dealt with addiction and trauma, <br>
as well as mental disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. I have gone to school at the university <br>
of Victoria for computer science, but I have not finished my degree yet. I am in a long term relationship with my <br>
partner Hannah, and we are both excited for me to take this course. I hope that I can learn the skills required to <br>
get a job in software development or game development, and follow my passion for programming to the next level! <br>
